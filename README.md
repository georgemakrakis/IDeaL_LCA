# IDeaL LCA

An open-source software for Life-cycle assessment (LCA) and sustainability assessment. Project of Innovative Design and Manufacturing Laboratory (IDeaL), University of Idaho.

A production version can be found in: https://webpages.uidaho.edu/ideal/lca.html

## Details

The tool follows four phases based on the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards. The three main LCA categories that are offered are:

1. Economic Assessment
2. Envorinmental Assessment
3. Social Assessment

The users are able to create their own databases using the tools, or import an existing database in CSV format. Samples of CSVs can be found under the [sampleCSVs](https://github.com/georgemakrakis/IDeaL_LCA/tree/master/sampleCSVs) folder. The final results can be exported in a PDF for future review.
